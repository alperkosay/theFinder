# @thefinder/react

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- f547cb5: Show how much each image would shrink before running "Optimize images". The dialog lists the estimated size and change of every image (e.g. `18 KB → ≈ 5.7 KB −68%`), marks the ones that would be skipped, and sums them up in the footer. Estimates follow the size, format and quality settings and are worked out again a moment after each change.
  
  `transform` takes a `dryRun` option: the images are encoded and their sizes reported, but nothing is written.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9277aa9: Quicker editing and more size information:
  
  - The context menu has "Edit" right under "Open": the image editor for pictures, the code editor for text files. "Open with" now only lists custom editors.
  - The image editor shows the estimated size of the result (e.g. `21 KB → 2.6 KB −88%`) and updates it a moment after each crop, resize, format or quality change.
  - The details panel works out folder sizes on its own, without a "Calculate" click: for a selected folder, for a selection with folders, and for the open folder when nothing is selected. Results are remembered until the files change.
  - The bulk image optimizer shows a growth as `+12%` instead of `12%`.
  - `client.size()` takes an optional `AbortSignal`.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 69df986: Fix context menus near the bottom and in a moved picker. A menu with no room below the pointer now opens above it, or ends at the bottom edge when it does not fit there either, instead of jumping to the top of the screen. The picker is now moved with its position instead of a transform, so context menus, Quick Look and the editors inside a dragged picker stay where they belong.
- 41017eb: Open context menus at the pointer on pages that style `<dialog>` themselves. A host rule such as `dialog { transform: translate(-50%, -50%) }` made the picker the containing block of its menus, so they opened shifted, e.g. in the picker launched from CKEditor. Menus now render in the top layer (popover) and are placed against the viewport whatever their ancestors do, and moving the picker no longer jumps when the page centers dialogs with a transform.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 0d26513: Move the picker by dragging its header, like a window, from `openFilePicker`, `useFilePicker` and the CKEditor plugins alike. It always opens centered, cannot be dragged off screen, and a double click on the header puts it back in the middle. Full-screen pickers on small screens stay put.
- 0d26513: Reopen the folder the user was last in. The folder is kept in localStorage next to the view preferences (`persistKey`), so the file manager and the picker (CKEditor included) each come back where they were left. A deleted or no longer allowed folder falls back to the root. `initialFolder` still wins; `rememberFolder={false}` turns it off.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ffefa5f: ciFinder is now theFinder. The packages moved from `@ci-finder/*` to `@thefinder/*`; the old packages are deprecated.
  
  | Before | After |
  |---|---|
  | `@ci-finder/core`, `/next`, `/react`, `/ckeditor` | `@thefinder/core`, `/next`, `/react`, `/ckeditor` |
  | `<CiFinder />`, `CiFinderProps` | `<TheFinder />`, `TheFinderProps` |
  | `createCiFinder`, `CiFinderOptions`, `CiFinderError`, `isCiFinderError` | `createTheFinder`, `TheFinderOptions`, `TheFinderError`, `isTheFinderError` |
  | `CiFinderClient` | `TheFinderClient` |
  | `registerCiFinder`, CKEditor toolbar button and config key `ciFinder` | `registerTheFinder`, toolbar button and config key `theFinder` |
  | CSS classes and variables `.cf-*`, `--cf-*` | `.tf-*`, `--tf-*` |
  | request header `x-ci-finder` | `x-thefinder` |
  | hidden folders `.cf-trash`, `.cf-versions`, `.cf-thumbs` | `.tf-trash`, `.tf-versions`, `.tf-thumbs` |
  | default `persistKey` `"ci-finder"` | `"thefinder"` |
  
  To keep the trash and version history of an existing volume, rename its three hidden folders (for example `mv uploads/.cf-trash uploads/.tf-trash`); `.cf-thumbs` can simply be deleted.

### Patch Changes

- 416329c: Show the new image right after saving it in the image editor. On volumes with a public `url`, previews, Quick Look and the details panel used the bare file URL, so the browser kept showing the copy it had already loaded. Display URLs now carry the modification time; "Copy link" and the details panel still give the clean public URL.
- d325b48: Fix submenus ("Open with", "View", "Sort by") opening in the wrong place, clipped and blanking their parent menu in the macOS skin. Submenus now render next to their parent menu and open to the left when there is no room on the right.
