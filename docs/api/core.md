# `@thefinder/core`

🌐 **English** · [Türkçe](tr/core.md)

The server engine. It has no runtime dependencies and runs with the Web-standard `Request → Response` signature on Node.js (≥ 18.17), Bun, Deno and edge runtimes.

## Entry points

| Subpath | Contents | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| `@thefinder/core` | Engine, file server, errors, helpers, types | Anywhere |
| `@thefinder/core/local` | `localDriver`, `LocalDriver` | Node.js, Bun (`node:fs`) |
| `@thefinder/core/s3` | `s3Driver`, `S3Driver` | Anywhere (Web Crypto + `fetch`) |
| `@thefinder/core/node` | `toNodeHandler`, `toExpress`, `toFastify`, `toKoa`, `toWebRequest`, `sendWebResponse` | Node.js |
| `@thefinder/core/sharp` | `sharpThumbnailer`, `sharpImages` | Node.js, Bun; requires `sharp` (≥ 0.33) |
| `@thefinder/core/client` | `createClient`, `TheFinderClient`, `ApiError`. See [client.md](client.md) | Browser and server |

## `createTheFinder(options)`

```ts
import { createTheFinder } from "@thefinder/core";
import { localDriver } from "@thefinder/core/local";

const finder = createTheFinder({
  volumes: [{ id: "files", name: "Files", driver: localDriver({ root: "./uploads" }), url: "/uploads" }],
});
```

Same as `new TheFinder(options)`. Throws an `Error` right away on a bad configuration (no volumes, the same volume id twice, `chunkSize` < 5 MiB while an S3 volume exists).

### `TheFinderOptions`

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `volumes` | `VolumeOptions[]` | — | Required, at least one volume |
| `chunkSize` | `number` | 5 MiB | Upload chunk size. Must be at least 5 MiB if there is an S3 volume. |
| `authorize` | `(ctx) => AuthorizeResult \| Promise<…>` | — | Runs before every command. See [Authorization](#authorization). |
| `onBeforeCommand` | `(ctx) => void \| Promise<void>` | — | After authorization, before the command. If it throws, the command doesn't run. |
| `onAfterCommand` | `(ctx & { result }) => void \| Promise<void>` | — | After the command succeeds. For file responses `result` is a `Response`. |
| `onEntriesChanged` | `(changes, ctx) => void \| Promise<void>` | — | After storage changes that move, remove, restore or replace existing entries. See [Keeping references in sync](#keeping-references-in-sync-onentrieschanged). |
| `maxEditSize` | `number` | 5 MiB | Upper limit for `get` / `put` (text) |
| `searchLimit` | `number` | 500 | Result limit for `search` |
| `thumbnails` | `ThumbnailOptions` | — | Server-side thumbnails. See [Thumbnails](#thumbnails). |
| `images` | `ImageProcessor` | — | Bulk image processing. See [Image processing](#image-processing). |
| `maxImageSize` | `number` | 60 MiB | Largest input for `transform` |
| `maxExtractSize` | `number` | 4 GiB | Total size `extract` may unpack (zip-bomb protection) |
| `csrfProtection` | `boolean` | `true` | Requires the `x-thefinder` header on `POST` requests |

### `VolumeOptions`

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | — | Required. Letters, digits and dashes, at most 32 characters; becomes the prefix of ids. |
| `name` | `string` | `id` | Display name of the root folder |
| `driver` | `StorageDriver` | — | Required |
| `url` | `string` | — | Public base URL of the files (`"/uploads"`, `"https://cdn.example.com"`). When set, every file gets a `url` field; the UI uses it for previews and in the picker. |
| `readOnly` | `boolean` | `false` | Rejects every write with `READ_ONLY`. Trash and version history are off too. |
| `showHidden` | `boolean` | `false` | Shows files starting with a dot. When off, names starting with a dot (`.htaccess`, `.env`...) cannot be created, uploaded or extracted from zips. The internal folders (`.tf-*`) stay hidden in every case. |
| `allowExtensions` | `string[]` | — | Only these extensions (lower case, no dot). Empty or missing means all. |
| `denyExtensions` | `string[]` | — | Extensions rejected on upload, create, rename, paste and extract |
| `maxUploadSize` | `number` | — | Byte limit for a single file (upload and binary `put`) |
| `permission` | `(action, path) => boolean` | — | `action`: `"read" \| "write" \| "delete"`. Returning `false` rejects the operation on that path with `FORBIDDEN` and sets the `read`/`write` flags in the UI. Folder operations apply to the contents too: a folder containing an item that can't be deleted can't be deleted, and unreadable subfolders are left out of search, size, zip download and archiving. |
| `trash` | `boolean \| { retentionDays? }` | `true`, 30 days | `false`: deleted items are removed right away |
| `versions` | `boolean \| { maxPerFile?, retentionDays? }` | `true`, 20 versions, forever | `retentionDays: 0` keeps forever. `false`: no versions are taken. |

### The `TheFinder` instance

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `handler(request): Promise<Response>` | Web-standard request handler. Use it directly in Bun, Deno, Hono, Next.js routes and Cloudflare Workers; for Node frameworks see the [adapters](#node-adapters). It is defined as an arrow function to keep its binding: `Bun.serve({ fetch: finder.handler })` is safe. |
| `execute<T>(cmd, params?, request?)` | Runs a command without HTTP; hooks and `authorize` still run. Throws `TheFinderError` on failure. Without `request` an empty `Request` is used. |
| `getVolume(id)` | Returns the `Volume` instance (advanced use) |
| `options` | The options with defaults applied |

```ts
// Example: removing versions older than 90 days in a cron job
await finder.execute("cleanup", { volume: "files", target: "versions", mode: "older", days: 90 });
```

### Authorization

```ts
type AuthorizeResult = boolean | void | { readOnly?: boolean };

interface CommandContext {
  cmd: string;                       // "ls", "upload"...
  request: Request;                  // the incoming request (cookies and headers can be read)
  params: Record<string, unknown>;   // merged query + body parameters
}
```

| `authorize` result | Effect |
|---|---|
| `true` or `undefined` | The request goes through |
| `false` | `403 FORBIDDEN` |
| `{ readOnly: true }` | The request goes through, but every volume is read-only for it. The `init` response carries `readOnly: true`, so the UI hides write actions by itself. |
| `throw new TheFinderError("UNAUTHORIZED")` | `401`; the UI calls `onUnauthorized` |

### Keeping references in sync: `onEntriesChanged`

Entry ids are made from the path (`<volume>_<base64url(path)>`), so a file gets a new id when it is renamed or moved. An application that refers to files by its own stable id (for example a CMS with a `uuid → path` table) can keep that table up to date with `onEntriesChanged`:

```ts
type EntryChange =
  | { type: "moved"; from: { volume: string; path: VolumePath }; to: { volume: string; path: VolumePath }; kind: EntryKind }
  | { type: "trashed"; volume: string; path: VolumePath; kind: EntryKind; trashId: string }
  | { type: "restored"; volume: string; trashId: string; path: VolumePath; kind: EntryKind }
  | { type: "deleted"; volume: string; path: VolumePath; kind: EntryKind } // removed for good, without the trash
  | { type: "purged"; volume: string; trashId: string } // removed from the trash for good
  | { type: "replaced"; volume: string; path: VolumePath }; // same file, same path, new content

const finder = createTheFinder({
  volumes: [/* ... */],
  async onEntriesChanged(changes, ctx) {
    for (const c of changes) {
      // A folder comes as one change: update its own path and every path below `from.path + "/"`.
      if (c.type === "moved") await db.files.movePath(c.from, c.to);
      if (c.type === "trashed") await db.files.markTrashed(c.volume, c.path, c.trashId);
      if (c.type === "restored") await db.files.restore(c.volume, c.trashId, c.path);
      if (c.type === "deleted") await db.files.removePath(c.volume, c.path);
      if (c.type === "purged") await db.files.removeTrashed(c.volume, c.trashId);
      if (c.type === "replaced") await db.files.touch(c.volume, c.path);
    }
  },
});
```

`EntryChange` and `EntryKind` (`"file" | "dir"`) are exported from `@thefinder/core`.

**When it is called**

- Once per command, with every change of that command in one array, after the storage work is over and before `onAfterCommand`. It is awaited. Commands that change nothing existing do not call it.
- A folder is a single change for the folder's own path. What is inside it moved, went to the trash or was deleted with it and is not listed.
- The paths are the real outcome. A paste that had to rename because of a clash reports the new name (`"/docs/a (2).txt"`), and a restore that could not go back to the same name reports the path it went to.
- `trashId` is the id of the item inside the trash: `Entry.trash.id` in the `trash` listing, which is also the last segment of the trash entry's path (`/.tf-trash/<trashId>`). It is not the entry `id`. The same item has the same `trashId` in `trashed`, `restored` and `purged`.
- A command with several items that fails half way (a paste of five items whose third one fails) still reports what it did before the failure; the request then fails as usual.
- `ctx` is the command's context, the same object `onBeforeCommand` gets. Changes made outside a command come with `ctx` set to `null`. Today every change happens inside a command (the retention cleanup of the trash runs inside `trash` and `purge`), but handle `null` so a later version can report outside changes without breaking your code.
- `execute()` calls it like an HTTP request does. A [read-only](#authorization) request cannot change anything, so it never calls it.
- Only changes made through theFinder are seen. Files changed directly on the disk or in the bucket are not reported.

**Events**

| Command | Change |
|---|---|
| `rename` | `moved` |
| `paste` with `cut` (also between volumes) | `moved`. Between volumes it is reported once the source is removed. |
| `paste` with `conflict: "overwrite"` over an existing item | A file over a file: `replaced` for the target (then `moved` with `cut`). Anything else (a folder replaced, or a file replacing a folder): `deleted` for the item that was there, since what was inside it is gone. |
| `paste` copy without a clash, or with `conflict: "rename"` / `"skip"` | none |
| `rm` (trash enabled) | `trashed` |
| `rm` with `permanent: true`, or on a volume with `trash: false` | `deleted` |
| `restore` | `restored` |
| `purge` with `ids`, or with `all: true` | `purged` for each item |
| `trash` / `purge`: items past `retentionDays` are removed when the trash is read | `purged`, in the call of that command |
| `upload` with `conflict: "overwrite"` over a file | `replaced`, when the last chunk lands |
| `put` with `id` | `replaced` |
| `revert` of an existing file | `replaced` (bringing a removed file back creates it: none) |
| `transform` in place (`output: "overwrite"`, same format) | `replaced` |
| `transform` writing a copy or another format with `conflict: "overwrite"` over a file | `replaced` for that file; the original is not changed |
| `transform` writing a new copy or another format, `dryRun` | none |
| `mkdir`, `mkfile`, `duplicate`, `archive`, `extract` (always into a new folder), `upload` / `put` of a new file | none |

**Errors.** It behaves like `onAfterCommand`: when it throws, the request fails (`500 INTERNAL` unless it throws a `TheFinderError`) and `onAfterCommand` does not run. The storage change has already happened by then, so the client sees an error for something that was done. Catch inside the hook (and queue a retry, for example) when your table being out of date should not fail the user's request. When the command itself failed and the hook throws too, the command's error is returned and the hook's error is logged with `console.error`.

## Drivers

### `localDriver(options)`, `@thefinder/core/local`

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `root` | `string` | — | Required. The volume root; a relative path is resolved against the working directory. |
| `create` | `boolean` | `true` | Creates the root folder if missing |
| `followSymlinks` | `boolean` | `true` | Follows symlinks. Links pointing outside the root are always hidden and give `FORBIDDEN` on access. |

- Files are first written to a temporary file and then moved into place, so an interrupted write never corrupts the real file. On Windows it retries if the target file is open in another program.
- `capacity()` reports the disk size (for the storage dashboard).
- `driver.root`: the resolved absolute root path. `driver.abs(path)`: converts a volume path to an OS path.

### `s3Driver(options)`, `@thefinder/core/s3`

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bucket` | `string` | — | Required |
| `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey` | `string` | — | Required |
| `sessionToken` | `string` | — | For temporary credentials |
| `region` | `string` | `"us-east-1"` | `"auto"` for Cloudflare R2 |
| `endpoint` | `string` | AWS | S3-compatible services: R2, MinIO, DigitalOcean Spaces, Backblaze B2… |
| `prefix` | `string` | bucket root | Key prefix used as the volume root, e.g. `"uploads/"` |
| `forcePathStyle` | `boolean` | `true` with a custom endpoint, `false` on AWS | `endpoint/bucket/key` style URLs |
| `delivery` | `"presigned" \| "proxy"` | `"presigned"` | How files reach the browser when the volume has no `url`: a redirect to a short-lived presigned URL, or streaming through the server |
| `presignExpiresIn` | `number` | 3600 | Presigned URL lifetime (seconds) |
| `partSize` | `number` | 8 MiB | Multipart part size for streamed writes (archives, cross-volume copies); at least 5 MiB |
| `fetch` | `typeof fetch` | global `fetch` | A custom `fetch` (tests, proxies) |

- Signing (SigV4) uses Web Crypto; no AWS SDK needed.
- Folders are modeled as prefixes; empty folders are kept with a `folder/` marker object.
- Move and rename are copy + delete; for folders every object under the prefix is processed.
- Uploads are multipart and the server keeps no state.
- For the image editor to read images on S3, allow `GET` from your app's origin in the bucket's CORS settings.

### The `StorageDriver` interface

To add a new storage (FTP, Azure Blob, Google Drive…) all you need is to implement this interface. The engine always hands the driver normalized paths (`/`, `/a/b.txt`); the driver never sees `..`.

| Method | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `kind` | ✔ | A short name (`"local"`, `"s3"`, `"ftp"`); the UI uses it to pick an icon |
| `stat(path)` | ✔ | A `DriverStat`, or `null` if it doesn't exist |
| `list(path)` | ✔ | Direct children of the folder |
| `mkdir(path)` | ✔ | Creates a single folder (the parent exists) |
| `read(path, range?)` | ✔ | `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`; `range` is an inclusive byte range |
| `write(path, data)` | ✔ | `data`: `ReadableStream`, `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBuffer` or `string`. Overwrites if it exists. |
| `remove(path)` | ✔ | Deletes a file, or a folder recursively |
| `copy(from, to)` | ✔ | Recursive copy; the target doesn't exist |
| `move(from, to)` | ✔ | Move / rename; the target doesn't exist (except for a case-only change) |
| `uploadChunk(chunk)` | ✔ | Writes one upload chunk; returns `{ session, done }`. `session` is driver-specific state that travels to the client and comes back with the next chunk. |
| `abortUpload(path, session)` | | Cleans up an unfinished upload |
| `hasSubdirs(path)` | | Whether the tree should show an expand arrow |
| `search(path, match, limit)` | | Fast recursive search; without it the engine walks the tree itself |
| `signedUrl(path, { download?, filename?, expiresIn? })` | | A direct (presigned) URL. If it returns a URL, the engine redirects with `302` instead of streaming the file. |
| `capacity()` | | `{ total, free }` or `null` |

```ts
interface DriverStat { name: string; path: VolumePath; kind: "file" | "dir"; size: number; mtime: number /* ms */ }

interface UploadChunk {
  path: VolumePath;   // validated, conflict-free target on the first chunk
  session?: string;   // state returned by the previous chunk; undefined on the first chunk
  index: number; total: number;
  size: number;       // total size of the file
  offset: number;     // byte offset of the chunk
  data: Uint8Array;
}
```

---

## Thumbnails

```ts
import { sharpThumbnailer } from "@thefinder/core/sharp";

createTheFinder({ volumes, thumbnails: { generator: sharpThumbnailer(), sizes: [128, 256, 512] } });
```

### `ThumbnailOptions`

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `generator` | `Thumbnailer` | — | Required |
| `sizes` | `number[]` | `[128, 256, 512]` | Allowed sizes; requests are rounded to the nearest one |
| `maxInputSize` | `number` | 40 MiB | Larger files are not thumbnailed; the original is sent |
| `concurrency` | `number` | 2 | Maximum number of generations at the same time |

Thumbnails are kept in the volume's `.tf-thumbs/` folder. They are regenerated when the source changes and cleaned up when the file is deleted, moved or renamed.

### `sharpThumbnailer(options?)`

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `quality` | 78 | WebP quality |
| `maxPixels` | 120,000,000 | Larger images are rejected (decompression bomb protection) |

Reads: jpg, jpeg, jfif, png, webp, gif, avif, tif, tiff, heic, heif. Applies EXIF orientation, keeps the aspect ratio, never upscales. If `sharp` can't be loaded the API keeps working, a warning is logged once and original images are sent.

### The `Thumbnailer` interface

```ts
interface Thumbnailer {
  extensions: string[];      // extensions it can read (lower case)
  extension?: string;        // extension of generated files, default "webp"
  generate(input: Uint8Array, size: number): Promise<Uint8Array>; // fit into a size×size box
}
```

## Image processing

```ts
import { sharpImages } from "@thefinder/core/sharp";

createTheFinder({ volumes, images: sharpImages() });
```

### `sharpImages(options?)`

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `maxPixels` | 120,000,000 | Decompression bomb protection |
| `effort` | 4 | WebP/AVIF encoding effort (speed ↔ size) |

Writes: jpeg (mozjpeg), png (palette when quality < 100), webp, avif, gif. Applies EXIF orientation, strips metadata, never upscales. Animation is kept when both the source and target formats support it. Throws `INVALID_IMAGE` on corrupt input and `TOO_LARGE` at the pixel limit. At most two images are processed at once; the rest wait in a queue.

### The `ImageProcessor` interface

```ts
interface ImageProcessor {
  extensions: string[];   // extensions it can read
  formats: ImageFormat[]; // formats it can write: "jpeg" | "png" | "webp" | "avif" | "gif"
  transform(input: Uint8Array, options: ImageTransformOptions): Promise<{ data: Uint8Array; width: number; height: number }>;
}

interface ImageTransformOptions { format: ImageFormat; width?: number; height?: number; quality?: number /* 1–100, default 80 */ }
```

## Serving files

### `createFileServer(options)`

A Web-standard handler that serves the files of a driver under a URL prefix.

```ts
Bun.serve({ routes: { "/uploads/*": createFileServer({ driver, prefix: "/uploads" }) } });
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `driver` | `StorageDriver` | — | Required |
| `prefix` | `string` | `""` | URL prefix |
| `showHidden` | `boolean` | `false` | Serves dotfiles (`.tf-*` is never served) |
| `authorize` | `(request, path) => boolean \| Promise<boolean>` | — | `false` → `404` (private files don't even reveal that they exist) |
| `cacheControl` | `string` | `"public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"` | |

Range, ETag/`304`, `HEAD`, the right `Content-Type` and `?download` are supported. Active content such as HTML and SVG is served with `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox`. Methods other than `GET`/`HEAD` return `405`.

### `serveFile(options)`

A low-level helper for building a file response in your own route.

| Option | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `request` | `Request` | Range and conditional GET headers are read from it |
| `stat` | `DriverStat` | For size, date and ETag |
| `open` | `(range?) => Promise<ReadableStream>` | Opens the content |
| `download` | `boolean` | Sends it as an `attachment` |
| `filename` | `string` | `Content-Disposition` name (default `stat.name`) |
| `cacheControl` | `string` | Default `"private, max-age=0, must-revalidate"` |
| `mime` | `string` | Guessed from the file name by default |

Other helpers: `contentDisposition(type, filename)` (RFC 6266/5987, UTF-8 names), `parseRange(header, size)` (`ByteRange`, `"invalid"` or `null`), `etagOf(stat)`.

---

## Node adapters

`@thefinder/core/node`. If a parser such as `express.json()` or `koa-bodyparser` has already read the body, the adapter rebuilds it.

| Function | Usage |
|---|---|
| `toNodeHandler(handler)` | `http.createServer(toNodeHandler(finder.handler))`. Also works as Express / Connect middleware; on errors it calls `next(err)`. |
| `toExpress(handler)` | Same as `toNodeHandler`: `app.all("/api/files", toExpress(finder.handler))` |
| `toKoa(handler)` | `router.all("/api/files", toKoa(finder.handler))` |
| `toFastify(handler, { path? })` | A Fastify plugin: `fastify.register(toFastify(finder.handler), { prefix: "/api/files" })`. Turns off body parsing in its own scope; `path` defaults to `"/"`. |
| `toWebRequest(req)` | `IncomingMessage` → `Request`. Honors `x-forwarded-proto` / `x-forwarded-host`. |
| `sendWebResponse(res, response)` | Streams a `Response` into a `ServerResponse` |

A file server can be mounted the same way: `app.get("/uploads/*", toExpress(createFileServer({ driver, prefix: "/uploads" })))`.

---

## Errors

```ts
import { TheFinderError, isTheFinderError } from "@thefinder/core";

throw new TheFinderError("UNAUTHORIZED");           // the message defaults to the code
throw new TheFinderError("FORBIDDEN", "This folder is off limits");
```

| Member | Description |
|---|---|
| `code: ErrorCode` | The full list of codes and their HTTP statuses: [protocol.md › Error codes](protocol.md#error-codes) |
| `status: number` | HTTP status derived from the code |
| `isTheFinderError(e)` | Type guard |

A `TheFinderError` thrown in a hook or a driver reaches the client with its own code and message. Any other error becomes `INTERNAL` and its details are written only to the server log.

## Helpers

| Export | Description |
|---|---|
| `encodeId(volume, path)` / `decodeId(id)` | Build and decode ids. `decodeId` throws `BAD_REQUEST` on invalid input. |
| `normalizePath(input)` | `"a//b/./c"` → `"/a/b/c"`. Doesn't try to resolve paths with `..`, backslashes or NUL; throws `BAD_REQUEST`. |
| `joinPath(dir, name)`, `dirname(path)`, `basename(path)` | POSIX volume path operations |
| `extname(name)` | Lower-case extension without the dot; `""` for dotfiles |
| `isInside(parent, child)` | Whether `child` is `parent` itself or below it |
| `mimeOf(name)` | MIME type from the extension (built-in table); `application/octet-stream` when unknown |
| `isActiveContent(mime)` | Types that can run scripts in the browser (HTML, SVG, XML, JS) |
| `createZipStream(sources)` | A dependency-free streaming zip writer (zip64 included). Already compressed formats are stored without compression. |
| `readZipEntries(read, size)` / `openZipEntry(read, entry)` | A random-access zip reader; the archive is never loaded into memory |
| `CSRF_HEADER` | `"x-thefinder"` |
| `VERSION` | Package version |
| `TRASH_ROOT`, `THUMBS_ROOT`, `VERSIONS_ROOT` | `"/.tf-trash"`, `"/.tf-thumbs"`, `"/.tf-versions"` |
| `isTrashPath(path)`, `isVersionsPath(path)`, `isReservedPath(path)` | Whether the path is inside one of the internal folders |
| `Volume`, `ThumbnailService` | Internal engine classes; for advanced use, their APIs may change in minor releases |

```ts
interface ZipSource {
  name: string;          // path inside the archive; folders end with "/"
  mtime: number;
  size?: number;         // used to decide on zip64 for very large files
  open?: () => Promise<ReadableStream<Uint8Array>>;
}
```

---

## Types

Every type can be imported with `import type { … } from "@thefinder/core"`. In browser code the same types are available from `@thefinder/core/client`.

### `Entry`

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `string` | Id |
| `parent` | `string \| null` | Id of the parent folder; `null` at the volume root |
| `volume` | `string` | Volume id |
| `name` | `string` | Name; at the volume root, the volume's `name` |
| `path` | `string` | Volume path |
| `kind` | `"file" \| "dir"` | |
| `size` | `number` | Bytes; 0 for folders (use the `size` command for the real size) |
| `mtime` | `number` | Last modified (ms) |
| `mime` | `string` | `"directory"` for folders |
| `read`, `write` | `boolean` | Permissions from `readOnly` and `permission` |
| `locked?` | `true` | Volume root |
| `hasDirs?` | `boolean` | Only in `tree` responses |
| `url?` | `string` | Direct URL of the file when the volume has a `url` |
| `trash?` | `{ id, originalPath, deletedAt }` | Only in trash responses; `path` is the original location |

### `VolumeInfo`

`{ id, name, kind, root: Entry, readOnly, maxUploadSize: number | null, allowExtensions: string[] | null, denyExtensions: string[], trash: { retentionDays, count } | null, versions: { maxPerFile, retentionDays } | null }`

`trash` and `versions` are `null` when that feature is off.

### `InitResult`

`{ volumes: VolumeInfo[], chunkSize, version, thumbnails: { sizes, extensions } | null, images: { extensions, formats } | null }`

### `FileVersion`

`{ id, size, createdAt, reason }`. `reason` tells what replaced the version: `edit`, `upload`, `replace`, `optimize`, `revert`…

### `StorageStats`

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `volume` | Volume id |
| `files`, `dirs`, `size` | User files only (trash, versions and cache excluded) |
| `categories` | `Record<"image" \| "video" \| "audio" \| "document" \| "archive" \| "code" \| "other", { files, size }>` |
| `largest` | The largest files (`Entry[]`), biggest first |
| `versions` | `{ files, count, size, orphaned, items: VersionedFile[] }` (`items` at most 200) |
| `trash` | `{ count, size }` |
| `cache` | `{ files, size }`: thumbnail cache |
| `capacity` | `{ total, free } \| null`: the disk, if the driver can report it |
| `truncated` | `true` if the volume is too large to scan completely |
| `scannedAt` | Scan time (ms) |
